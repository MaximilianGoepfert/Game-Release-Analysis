## Conclusions
- Twitter Presence:
  + Modern Warfare: Large twitter presence at point of release
  + Outer Worlds: Gradual build up of twitter presence throughout pre-release schedule
- Twitter Content:
  + Modern Warfare: Majority of tweets were retweets, relating to a ‘giveaway’ competition
  + Outer Worlds: Majority of tweets were unique suggesting a greater engagement with the pre-release programme
- Sentiment
  + Significant differences between the sentiment of tweets pre- and post-release
  + Modern Warfare: Sentiment reduced following release
  + Outer Worlds: Sentiment increased following release
- Sales Figures
  + Modern Warfare: Highest sales following release - as expected from a well-known franchise
  + Outer Worlds: Second highest sales in October - surprising for a game without an existing fanbase - suggesting a successful marketing strategy
